        <h1>The Black Panther</h1>
        <p>
            The Black Panther is able to maintain continuous strenuous physical action for an indefinite period of time. 
            This based on her body converting yellow solar radiation directly to energy,
             but is limited by physiological and psychological needs to eat, drink, and sleep to defeat supergirl.
